# Chapter 2 - Fundamental Observtions

## Night sky is dark

### Calculating the luminosity of the night sky

this says that if sky is decked with stars, the luminosity will be wayyy higher,
so its not.

- $$ \lambda = \frac{1}{n\*\pi R\*^2 }$$

This is the average distance at which we can see star. which is finite, that
means you should see a star upto that point.

Basically in layman terms, if density is high enough that means sky will be
covered with stars. (lambda is distance, n is density, R is star radius)

- $$ \lambda = \frac{1}{n\*\pi R\*^2 }$$

$\Omega$ is surface angle of our star:
$$ \Omega = \frac{\pi R\*^2}{4\pi r^2} $$

Now the flux of the luminosity of the star is
$$ f = \frac{L\*}{4\pi r^2} $$

Now the ratio of both gives surface brightness of that star:
$$ \Sigma = \frac{f}{\Omega} = \frac{L\*}{\piR\*^2} $$

### Wrong assumptions

- Universe is transparent
- Universe is infinitely large
- Universe is infinitely old
- Universe is static

i left a lot of calcs im sorry
