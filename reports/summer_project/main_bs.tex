\section{Summary}

The initial description of my summer project was to read given chapters of two
books, \texttt{Introduction to Cosmology - Barbara Ryden } and the
\texttt{Introductionn to Elementary Particles - David Griffiths}. But when
reading certain chapters of Ryden, I noticed that I don't really have the
mathematical background for understanding certain topics like tensors, curvature and
special theory of relativity. So following my advisor's recommendation, I
had to read certain chapters of
\texttt{Mathematical Methods for Physicists - George B. Arfken}, and also some
parts of \texttt{Introduction to Electrodynamics - Griffiths} to make it easier
for me to understand concepts. After doing so
I have completed the required chapters in cosmology, but for the second book
in the reading project, I have only covered two chapters. Thus in this report
I am going to include both Cosmology and related Mathematics that I have
learned.

\section{Problems}

As instructed by my advisor, I have to pick a few problems and solve them
as a part of my report. I have picked these problems from a combination of books
as referenced.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item 1.1 (dodelson)
	\item 1.4
	\item 2.5
	\item 2.4 (ryden)
	\item 4.5
	\item 4.1.2 (arfken)
	\item 4.2.7
\end{enumerate}
